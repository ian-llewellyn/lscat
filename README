lscat
=====

Have you ever been exploring a filesystem and found yourself repeatedly
pressing Up to recall the last command, an 'ls -l' for example, to append the
name of a file you're interested in. Then you have to go to the start of the
line to change the 'ls -l' to 'cat' or 'vim' to do something with the contents
of that file?

That's fine a couple of times, but as your explorations go on, you get tired of
the repetition. Enter lscat/llcat/lsvim/llvim/lsvimr/llvimr. This simple script
detects whether the passed in arguments are directories or files and uses the
appropriate command based on what it finds.
