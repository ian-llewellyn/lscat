lscat
=====

Have you ever been exploring a filesystem and found yourself repeatedly
pressing Up to recall the last command, an 'ls -l' for example, to append the
name of a file you're interested in. Then you have to go to the start of the
line to change the ls -l to cat just to see the contents of that file?

That's fine a couple of times, but as your explorations go on, you get tired of
the repetition. Enter lscat/llcat. This simple script detects whether the
passed in arguments are directories or files and uses the appropriate command
based on what it finds.
